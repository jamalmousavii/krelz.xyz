# Krelz Network — Code Audit & Remediation Report

**Date:** 2026-09-26
**Scope:** `krelz-public/` (backend Express/`pg`/`ws`, Next.js 14 frontend, Electron/CLI miner app, install scripts, nginx/systemd deploy files, docs)
**Constraint:** production (`https://krelz.xyz`) is **live with real users** — every change is backward-compatible; migrations are additive and idempotent.
**Verdict:** 4 critical, 12 high and 20+ medium findings. **All code findings below marked `FIXED` are implemented and verified in this working tree**; items marked `OPEN` remain and are listed in §7 with a recommended next step.

> **خلاصه به فارسی:** این گزارش یافته‌های امنیتی و مالی پروژه را با ذکر فایل و خط نشان می‌دهد. مهم‌ترین باگ — بازنشانی سهمیه روزانه در هر درخواست (استفاده نامحدود رایگان) — همراه با لو رفتن توکن ریست پسورد، کش کردن پاسخ‌های احراز هویت‌شده، و بازپرداخت وب‌هوک پرداخت، رفع شده است. تست‌ها (`backend/tests/`) و CI اضافه شده‌اند. موارد باقی‌مانده در بخش ۷ آمده است.

---

## 1. Method

1. Full read of backend source (`backend/src/**`), frontend pages/components, miner app, install scripts, deploy configs.
2. Static review for auth/authorization, money flow, concurrency, input validation, logging, availability.
3. Runtime verification where a dependency was available (see §6): `node --check` on every source file, backend boot smoke test, `next build`, `jest` suite.
4. Every fix is additive (no breaking API changes) or returns an explicit `410 Gone` for endpoints that were already unreachable from the shipped frontend.

## 3. Critical & high findings in detail

### C1 — Daily free allowance reset on every request (money)

`pg` returns `DATE` (OID 1082) as a JS `Date` pinned to **local** midnight. The comparison `last_reset_date !== today` therefore never matched, and the billing block reset `tokens_used_today` to 0 on every request — 1000 free tokens *per request*.

**Fix (two independent guards):**
- `backend/src/database/pool.js:11` — `types.setTypeParser(1082, v => v)` so the column comes back as the exact `'YYYY-MM-DD'` string.
- `backend/src/routes/chat.js:97-111` — `todayKey()` and `toDateKey()` now use the **same** calendar on both sides (local components). Previously `toDateKey` used `toISOString()` while the stored value was local midnight: in any UTC+n timezone that shifts the date back one day and reintroduces the bug.
- Regression test: `backend/tests/models.pricing.test.js` → *"normalises Date values pinned to LOCAL midnight without shifting the day"*.

### C2 — Reset token leaked (account takeover)

`POST /api/auth/forgot-password` returned `{ reset_token }` to the caller and logged it. Anyone could request a reset for a victim's email and read the token from the response.

**Fix:** `backend/src/routes/auth.js`:
- Token is delivered by email only (Resend via `backend/src/services/email.js`).
- When `RESEND_API_KEY` is absent in production the endpoint returns **503 before any account lookup** — so the status code cannot enumerate accounts, and the caller never believes an email was sent (`auth.js:278-286`).
- The dev-only escape hatch (`reset_token` in the response) runs only when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`.
- New page `frontend/pages/reset-password.js` consumes `?token=`; `Navbar` no longer reads `data.reset_token`.

### C3 — Response cache could leak across users

`cacheMiddleware` keys only on `req.originalUrl`. Any authenticated endpoint mounted behind it would cache one user's body and replay it to others.

**Fix:** `backend/src/cache.js:39-46` — requests carrying `Authorization` **or** a resolved `req.user`, and every non-GET, bypass the cache entirely (`isCacheableRequest`, unit-tested). `/api/miners` (which returns `miner_token`) is no longer mounted behind the cache at all.

### C4 — Payment webhook trust

IPN had no signature verification in the shipped path, no idempotency (replayed webhooks re-credited), and the credit amount was taken from the payload rather than the stored order.

**Fix:**
- `services/nowpayments.js:73-95` — HMAC-SHA512 over the key-sorted payload with `timingSafeEqual`, **fail closed** when `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` is unset.
- `routes/payments.js` — deposit rows now store `order_id` (new additive column + indexes in `migrate.js`); the webhook **claims** the pending row inside a transaction (`UPDATE … WHERE status='pending' AND (order_id=$3 OR processor_id=$3 …) RETURNING`), credits the **stored** amount, and answers `deduped: true` on replay.
- Tests: `backend/tests/ipn.test.js` (correct sig, wrong secret, tampered amount, missing/short signature).

### H1/H2 — Admin role and JWT hardening

- `validate.js:20` restricts `role` to `user|miner` (no `admin`).
- `auth.js` register forces `role='user'` and uses `ON CONFLICT (email)` to close the registration race.
- `middleware/auth.js` — `jwt.verify(..., { algorithms: ['HS256'] })`, and `requireAdmin` re-reads the role from Postgres with a 60s cache, **failing closed** if the DB is unreachable.
- Tests: `backend/tests/auth.middleware.test.js` (wrong secret, hand-crafted `alg:none` JWT, forged admin claim).

### H9/H10 — Production surface area

- `DEVELOP.md` no longer contains the server IP or `ssh root@…` (moved to the private vault). **Treat the old value as exposed and rotate SSH access accordingly.**
- `deploy/krelz-miner.service` now runs `src/cli.js` (headless) instead of the Electron `main.js`, drops the hardcoded `WALLET_ADDRESS`, adds `TimeoutStopSec` and systemd hardening (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=full`, `RestrictAddressFamilies`, …).

## 4. Money-flow invariants (chat billing)

Since v3.24.0 (daily allowance removed) billing is a single transaction with a row lock — the only place in the codebase that mutates a balance:

1. Lock `user_coin_balances` with `FOR UPDATE` and debit the full `cost` (wallet only).
2. Credit the miner **only if it actually served the task** (`minerId && servedByMiner`), at 90% (`MINER_REVENUE_SHARE`).
3. Insufficient funds → rollback of nothing (no debit happened), the API answers `402 insufficient_balance`, and the pre-stored task answer is not returned to the caller.
4. Pre-flight `hasWalletFunds()` rejects paid-model requests **before** any GPU/Ollama work when the wallet is empty.
5. Guests (no JWT) never enter the payment block — free by product decision (see §H-limits).

Invariants asserted by tests: pricing = `tokens × outputPrice / 1e6`, revenue share `0.9`, catalog/default-model consistency (`tests/models.pricing.test.js`).

---

## 5. What changed outside the backend

- **Frontend:** shared `utils/api.js` (`apiFetch` + `useAuth`) replaces render-time redirects and gives every page identical 401 handling; admin page gated on `role` with a proper access-denied state; `Number(x).toFixed()` guards; `pages/404.js`, `pages/500.js`; internal navigation via `next/link`; env-driven API rewrite; generated `favicon.ico/svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192/512.png`, `og-image.png` (reproducible: `python3 scripts/generate_assets.py`).
- **Deploy:** nginx gains `limit_req`/`limit_conn` in front of the API and a CSP (Google Sign-In is the only third party allowed to execute/frame); systemd unit fixed as above.
- **Tests/CI:** `backend/tests/` (43 assertions, no DB/Redis required) + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (syntax check + jest + `next build` + `next lint` + `bash -n` on install scripts).
- **Docs:** `docs/api.md` rewritten against the real route table; this report added.

## 6. Verification performed

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Backend syntax | `node --check` on every `backend/src/**/*.js` | pass |
| Backend boot | `node src/server.js` with no DB | boots; `/health` → **503 degraded**, `/health/live` → **200**, `/api/token/balance` → **401**, `/api/models` → 200 (degrades gracefully) |
| Unit tests | `cd backend && npm test` | **43/43 pass** (6 suites) |
| Frontend build | `cd frontend && npm run build` | pass (12 routes) |
| Frontend lint | `cd frontend && npm run lint` | pass (warnings only, no errors) |
| Install scripts | `bash -n miner-app/*.sh` | pass |
| Assets | `file frontend/public/*` | valid PNG/ICO/SVG, correct dimensions |

## 7. Open risks & recommended next steps

| # | Risk | Recommendation | Effort |
|---|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **`RESEND_API_KEY` / `EMAIL_FROM` not set** → password reset returns 503 in production | Set them in the production env (already documented in `backend/.env.example`), then verify a reset end-to-end | S |
| 2 | Reset token stored in plaintext (L1) | Store `sha256(token)` only; compare hashes | S |
| 3 | 7-day JWT in `localStorage` (L2/L3) | Short-lived access token + server-side revocation list (Redis) wired into `authenticate` | M |
| 4 | Payout vs ledger not atomic (L4) | Wrap debit+payout-insert in one transaction, or write the ledger row first with `status='pending'` and update it | M |
| 5 | Missing rate limits on secondary auth routes (L5) | Reuse `authLimiter` for `/google`, `/set-password`, `/change-password` | S |
| 6 | Guest chat is free by design (product decision) | Current mitigation is 6 req/min/IP + the global limiter + nginx `limit_req`. Revisit if abused; a per-IP daily token bucket is the natural next step | M |
| 7 | `krelz-private/` is empty (config/contracts/scripts/secrets placeholders) | Decide whether this repo stays public-only; secrets must never land here. `.env` is git-ignored | — |
| 8 | Docs describe burning/KRELZ token flows the code never implements (L7) | Either implement or mark `tokenomics.md`/`architecture.md` as "planned" | S |
| 9 | No DB-backed integration tests | Add a dockerised Postgres job to CI and cover register→login→chat-billing→IPN end-to-end | L |
| 10 | Old server IP in git history (H9) | Rotate SSH keys/limits; consider history rewrite if the repo is ever published | S |

---

## 8. Deployment checklist (production, no downtime)

1. `git pull` on the VPS → `backend/`, `frontend/`.
2. Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` in `backend/.env` (only required new vars).
3. `cd backend && node src/database/migrate.js` — additive and idempotent (`coin_deposits.order_id`, lookup indexes, `schema_migrations`). Re-running is safe; exits non-zero on failure.
4. `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`.
5. `nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx` — verify `/health` still returns 200 in production (it will return **503 if Postgres is down** — that is intentional; update the monitor to expect 200 only when healthy).
6. `systemctl restart krelz-backend` — SIGTERM now drains HTTP + WS and closes pool/Redis.
7. Miner hosts: `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart krelz-miner` (unit now runs `src/cli.js`).
8. Smoke: `curl -s https://krelz.xyz/health`, send one chat message as a guest and one as a signed-in user, confirm `payment_status` behaves (`free` for guests, `paid` for signed-in users).
